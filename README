Notes:
About 5 hrs spent on project.
large amounts of testing was not done due to time constraints and not wanting to go far above 5 hours to invalidate the prompt.
some of the quick and dirty solutions provide incorrect responses. THIS was done knowingly to show how purely mathmatical approacches can get
  large, complicated, or lead to incorrect results.
